            <h2>Why Now</h2>

            <p>
            UNSCENE was created at a moment when regional voices, independent storytelling, and emotionally driven work are more vital than ever.
            </p>

            <p>
            As access to culture shifts and traditional pathways narrow, we exist to ensure that ambitious, locally rooted stories continue to be created, shared, and experienced - without losing their integrity or emotional depth.

                    Furqan is the one who starts with “what if…” and then refuses to let it go.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a background in psychology and years spent working as an SEN teacher and tutor, he's always been interested in how people think, feel, and experience the world differently. That curiosity runs straight through his work, especially his love for characters who live on the edges, between worlds, or just slightly out of step with everyone else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He's been obsessed with stories, music, and performance for as long as he can remember, and has a lifelong habit of falling a bit too deeply into imaginary worlds. He listens to everything, writes constantly, and tends to fully become the characters he's creating - voices, flaws, fears and all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Known for his focus (and his inability to switch off), Furqan is a proud workaholic with a vivid imagination, a soft spot for the unknown, and a strong belief that creativity should be inclusive, emotionally honest, and open to everyone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At UNSCENE, he shapes stories with heart, curiosity, and just enough obsession to make them linger.

                <p>
                    Douy is usually the first to say, “what if it looked like this instead?” - and he's almost always right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a first-class degree in Computer Animation Arts, Douy has a rare ability to take loose ideas, half-sentences, and vague feelings and turn them into fully formed visual worlds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He notices everything - light, colour, negative space, tiny details most people walk straight past - and somehow holds multiple perspectives in his head at once.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He has an instinct for atmosphere and a visual sensitivity that makes things feel right before you can explain why. Whether he's shaping a visual identity, building a mood, or obsessing over the smallest design choice, Douy brings ideas to life with clarity, care, and quiet confidence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At UNSCENE, Douy is the keeper of the look, the feel, and the tone, making sure every project not only tells a story but looks like it belongs to its world.
