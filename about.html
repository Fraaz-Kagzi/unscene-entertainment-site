            <p>Regional voices matter more than ever.</p>

            <p>
                As access to culture shifts and traditional pathways narrow, independent storytelling becomes essential. We exist to ensure that locally rooted, emotionally driven stories continue to be created, shared, and experienced with integrity.
            </p>

            <p>Stories should not lose their depth simply because their origins are regional.</p>

                    <p>Furqan begins with a simple question: what if?</p>

                    <p>
                    With a background in psychology and years spent working as an SEN teacher and tutor, he has long been fascinated by how people think, feel, and experience the world differently. That curiosity shapes his writing, especially his connection to characters who exist on the edges, between worlds, or slightly out of step with those around them.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stories, music, and performance have been constant companions.</p>

                    <p>He listens widely, writes constantly, and often inhabits the characters he creates, voices and flaws included.</p>

                    <p>
                    Focused, driven, and unapologetically imaginative, Furqan believes creativity should be inclusive, emotionally honest, and open to everyone.
                    </p>

                    <p>At UNSCENE, he shapes stories that feel personal, immersive, and difficult to forget.</p>

                    <p>Douy often sees the finished world before anyone else does.</p>

                    <p>
                    With a first-class degree in Computer Animation Arts, he has a rare ability to transform ideas into fully realised visual environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    He notices light, colour, composition, and the details others overlook. He holds multiple perspectives at once and refines them with care.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    His instinct for atmosphere ensures that each project feels cohesive and intentional. Every visual decision supports the emotional tone of the story.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At UNSCENE, Douy protects the look and feel of each production, ensuring that every story not only speaks but belongs to its world.
